In general, you can make a while loop do anything that a for loop can do but with slightly different syntax, so if you find youself understanding while loops better than for loops, you can just focus on using them. ","pos":27,"type":"cell"}
{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0dda2f","input":"While the code still runs 5 times, the output has changed. It now includes 5!

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"44ec76","input":"We can see that the variable \"i\" is increased each time the loop is run. Then, once \"i\" stops being less than 5, the code stops running.

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"9621f6","input":"You should notice the range function as a part of the for loop, this is because python only has for loops that iterate over a list. For now, you don't have to worry about what the means, but the important take away is that the range function allows you to loop from 0 to the number in the parentheses, setting \"i\" to the current value. This value changes every loop through. We can see this below.","pos":23,"type":"cell"}
