{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0d8c33","input":"You should notice the range function as a part of the for loop, this is because python only has for loops that iterate over a list. For now, you don't have to worry about what the means, but the important take away is that the range function allows you to loop from 0 to the number in the parentheses, setting \"i\" to the current value. This value changes every loop through. We can see this below.","pos":23,"state":"done","type":"cell"}

Next we need to pick a random number between 1 and the user selected number.","pos":40,"state":"done","type":"cell"}
{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"381da3","input":"In this section, we will talk about for loops and while loops. In general, for loops are better for running a block of code a set number of times and while loops are better for running a block of code until some condition changes or is met.

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"bf2891","input":"In the block below, we will make a while loop that runs 5 times ( mimicking \"for i in range(5)\" ).
