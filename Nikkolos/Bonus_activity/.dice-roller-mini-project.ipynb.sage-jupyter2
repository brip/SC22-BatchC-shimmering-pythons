{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0fe40a","input":"You should notice the range function as a part of the for loop, this is because python only has for loops that iterate over a list. For now, you don't have to worry about what the means, but the important take away is that the range function allows you to loop from 0 to the number in the parentheses, setting \"i\" to the current value. This value changes every loop through. We can see this below.","pos":23,"type":"cell"}

After we import it, we will generate and print a random decimal between 0 and 1","pos":13,"type":"cell"}
{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"28fd4e","input":"Next, we'll take a look at while loops. In general, you can make a while loop do anything that a for loop can do but with slightly different syntax, so if you find youself understanding while loops better than for loops, you can just focus on using them.
